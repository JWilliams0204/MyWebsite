# MyFirstWebsiteJW

This is my profile website that i created using bootstrap. I also created a css external page to contribute with the design and color of the webpage. With bootstrap i created a navbar that contains the links to contact page, and portfolio page. In the index page i used a bootstrap card, that holds my picture and also my short bio. In the contact page i created a container, with 2 form groups for your name, and email with a submit button. In my portfolio page i have another container with links to some of my hoeworks, and group project.
